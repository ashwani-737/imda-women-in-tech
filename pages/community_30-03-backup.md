<h2>20/20/20</h2>
<strong>Postponed till further notice due to COVID-19 situation – Do watch this space for update</strong>
<p>The 20/20/20 initiative aims to foster interest in a tech career at a young age, and thereafter the pursuit of STEM subjects in institutes of higher learning and eventually a career in tech.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Key perceptions are shaped during the teenage years, thus students aged 15-17 are selected, providing them with more knowledge about the exciting nature and diversity of jobs in the tech sector, and connecting them with real-life female role models in Singapore</li>
  <li>20 girls from each of the 20 secondary schools will be paired with 20 companies for a half-day learning journey to the company. Company’s female leaders will lead the visit and showcase a variety of job roles, and their impact on business and society.</li>
   <li>The learning journey is opened to female students (including some boys) who are interested in STEM and infocomm media-related subjects.</li>
   <li>The participating companies come from a mix of sectors, including games, e-commerce, telecoms, financial payments and government agencies.</li>
</ul>
